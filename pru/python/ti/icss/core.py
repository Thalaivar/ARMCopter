########## Programmable Real-Time Unit (PRU) core ##############################
##
## ICSS has two PRU v3 cores equipped with several XFR components:
##       0  multiplier/MAC  (32 Ã— 32 -> 64-bit, single cycle)
##       1  CRC module  (added in ICSS v1)
##      10  scratch pad 0  (30 words)
##      11  scratch pad 1  (30 words)
##      12  scratch pad 2  (30 words)
##      14  direct core-to-core transfer
##      20  mii-rt L2 ringbuffer (bank 0)
##      21  mii-rt L2 ringbuffer (bank 1)
##
## The scratch pads are shared between the cores, allowing fast data exchange.
## In rare instances they may be omitted.  The MAC, CRC, and mii-rt buffers are
## private for each core.
##
## When mii-rt is present but not used or its L2 ringbuffer is not enabled, XFR
## 20 and 21 can be used as extra scratchpads (12 words each) for R2-R13.
##
##
## R30 and R31 support I/O functionality similar to original PRUSS but with
## more and more features added in subsequent revisions.
##
##
## The memory map for a core is:
##      000'00'000 - 000'3f'fff   local PRU subsystem
##      000'40'000 - 000'7f'fff   linked PRU subsystem (if any)
##      000'80'000 - fff'ff'fff   32-bit master port to L3 (one per core)
##
## Note however that dram0 and dram1 are swapped for core 1, allowing each core
## to access its own data ram at address 0x0.
##
## The cores do not have direct access to debug registers or instruction RAM.
##
## Requests to the master ports can optionally subtract 0x80'000 from addresses
## to allow accessing address range 000'00'000 - fff'7f'fff of the L3.  This
## can be configured per core in the subsystem control module (see icss/cfg.py).
##
## Beware that the master ports are disabled by default and need to be enabled
## via the subsystem control module to avoid lockup.
##
##
## The PRU core has a 32-bit VBUSP slave port with three address spaces:
##	core control registers
##	debug registers
##	instruction ram (iram)
##
## The debug and iram spaces are only accessible when the core is halted.
##
## In PRU-ICSS, the core control and debug register spaces are adjacent, hence
## they are viewed as one structure here.

            # After clearing "core enabled" the core halts at the next
            # instruction boundary.  If the core is sleeping, it is necessary
            # to force wakeup to let the sleep instruction complete.  Check the
            # "core busy" flag has cleared to confirm the core has halted.
            #
            # Single-step mode causes the "core enabled" bit to clear and the
            # core to halt after executing one instruction.
            #
            # The halt instruction causes the core to halt on (rather than
            # after) that instruction: neither the program counter nor the
            # cycle counter is advanced.  An invalid instruction behaves
            # similarly but also sets the exception flag.

            # writing 2 to control will start the core at reset_pc.
